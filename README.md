# SenseNet Aspect Handler

This repository contains a webform page with a custom odata function to assist with setup aspect fields on content from UI. This solution works for sn webpages module only at the moment. It is possible it will be made indepentent from the obsolate webform pages but it was designed to work in the sn explore for the admins.

*The original source code was made by an ex-colleague for a project years back now. I've made minor changes over time and made it an independent solution and installabe package to save and share it for posterity.*
